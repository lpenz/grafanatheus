# grafanatheus

Create a single read-only docker image with grafana, prometheus and
some exporters in the spirit of [fleet.linuxserver.io].

Part of the idea is to have a single container that is able to monitor
and graph the local machine with mihnimal setup, and to be able to
explore and test parameters before a wider deployment.
